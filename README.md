## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Media Query (com foco no uso de **min-aspect-ratio** para responsividade)

### What I learned


I learned how to deal with responsiveness using **Media Query** through **min-aspect-ratio**, expanding the possibilities beyond the use of **max-width** and **min-width**.

### Continued development

I intend to learn about frameworks that facilitate development and explore other approaches to improve project responsiveness. I also want to apply tools like **Sass** and **Less**, whether updating this project or implementing them in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Documentation on Media Query aspect-ratio](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS/@media/aspect-ratio) - This resource was essential for understanding and implementing **aspect-ratio** in responsiveness.
- [Curso de HTML e CSS da Alura](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/html-css-responsividade-publicacao-projetos) - 
An excellent course that helped improve knowledge about HTML, CSS and responsiveness.
